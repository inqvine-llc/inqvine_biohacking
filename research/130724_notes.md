# Research Notes: Building a Functional Prosthetic Dog Leg
Date: July 13, 2024

## 1. Introduction
These notes outline the key considerations and components for designing and building a functional prosthetic leg for dogs. The goal is to create a prosthetic that mimics natural leg mechanics, provides balance and stability, and adapts to various terrains.

## 2. Anatomical Considerations
Understanding canine anatomy is crucial for prosthetic design:

- Shoulder joint (scapulohumeral joint): Ball-and-socket joint
- Scapula: Flat, triangular bone, not directly attached to spine
- Humerus: Connects shoulder to elbow
- Radius and ulna: Two bones of the forearm
- Carpus: Complex wrist joint
- Metacarpals and phalanges: Form the paw

## 3. Prosthetic Components

### 3.1 Custom Socket
- Material: Thermoplastic or carbon fiber
- Features:
  - Molded to fit residual limb
  - Padded with soft, moisture-wicking material
  - Ventilation to prevent heat buildup

### 3.2 Shock-Absorbing Mechanism
- Purpose: Mimic natural shock absorption
- Options:
  - Springs
  - Hydraulics

### 3.3 Articulated Joint
- Mimics natural joint movement (e.g., elbow or knee)
- Can be passive or actively controlled

### 3.4 Lightweight Shaft
- Material: Carbon fiber or titanium
- Adjustable length to match natural leg

### 3.5 Artificial Foot
- Flexible paw pad:
  - Material: Durable silicone or specialized rubber
  - Features: Shock-absorbing, high-friction surface
- Articulated toes:
  - Individual segments with flexible joints
  - Spring-loaded for natural splay and grip
- Textured sole:
  - Tread pattern similar to dog's paw pad
  - Varying hardness for different sole parts
- Sensory feedback system:
  - Pressure sensors
  - Accelerometers and gyroscopes
- Adaptive stiffness system
- Proper weight distribution design
- Weather adaptability features

### 3.6 Attachment System
- Comfortable harness
- Quick-release mechanism

### 3.7 Control System (for advanced prosthetics)
- Microcontroller
- Sensors throughout the prosthetic
- Power source

## 4. Material Considerations

### 4.1 For Joints and High-Wear Areas
- UHMWPE (Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene)
  - High impact resistance
  - Low friction
  - Easily machined or 3D printed

### 4.2 For Flexible Components
- TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
  - Excellent shock absorption
  - Durable and abrasion-resistant
  - 3D printable

### 4.3 For Structural Components
- Aluminum alloy (e.g., 6061-T6)
  - High strength-to-weight ratio
  - Good heat dissipation
- Carbon fiber reinforced nylon
  - High strength and stiffness
  - Lightweight

## 5. Manufacturing Methods
1. 3D printing: For complex shapes and prototyping
2. CNC machining: For precise parts
3. Laser cutting: For flat structural components
4. Injection molding: For mass production of plastic parts

## 6. Key Design Considerations
1. Weight: Minimize to reduce fatigue
2. Durability: Withstand daily use in various environments
3. Adjustability: Accommodate growth and adaptation
4. Comfort: Prevent chafing and pressure sores
5. Natural movement: Allow for natural gait
6. Ease of use: Simple to put on and remove
7. Ventilation: Prevent heat and moisture buildup

## 7. Biomechanical Considerations
- Mimic natural leg length and proportions
- Replicate normal joint angles and range of motion
- Design for proper weight distribution and balance

## 8. Testing and Refinement
- Gait analysis to ensure natural movement
- Pressure mapping to identify potential problem areas
- Durability testing in various environments
- User feedback for comfort and functionality

## 9. Future Developments
- Integration of smart materials for adaptive response
- AI-driven gait optimization
- Improved sensory feedback systems
- Biodegradable or eco-friendly materials

These research notes provide a comprehensive overview of the key aspects to consider when designing and building a functional prosthetic dog leg. Further research and development in specific areas will be necessary for implementation.
